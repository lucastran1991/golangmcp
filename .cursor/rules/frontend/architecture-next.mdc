- Use App Router in `frontend/app/` where possible; `pages/` only if required.
- Organize shared code in `frontend/lib/`, `frontend/components/`, and `frontend/hooks/`.
- Prefer Server Components by default; elevate to Client Components only for interactivity.
- Co-locate route-specific components under the route directory.
- Keep API calls in `frontend/lib/` or server actions; avoid scattering fetch logic.
