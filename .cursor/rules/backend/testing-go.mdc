- Write unit tests for every handler and service.
- Prefer table-driven tests with subtests (t.Run).
- Keep tests deterministic; avoid time and network flakiness.
- For HTTP handlers, use `httptest` and check status codes and JSON bodies.
- Aim for fast tests (< 2s total per package when possible).
