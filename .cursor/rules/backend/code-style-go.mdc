- Follow Effective Go guidelines.
- Run `gofmt` / `go fmt` for formatting.
- Use GoDoc comments for all exported functions, types, and packages.
- Keep functions focused; prefer small, composable functions.
- Avoid stutter in names (e.g., `user.UserService` -> `service.User`).
- Prefer explicit error handling; no naked panics in app code.
- Avoid global state; pass dependencies explicitly via constructors.
- For concurrency: use contexts, avoid goroutine leaks, and document ownership.
