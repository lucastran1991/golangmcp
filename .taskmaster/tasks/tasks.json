        "description": "Implement a command management system with backend command execution service, frontend terminal-like interface component, security command whitelist and user permission checks, and real-time WebSocket for live command output streaming.",
        "details": "The implementation will involve the following steps:\n\n1. Develop the backend command execution service with security validation, using Task #31 (Implement Database Performance Optimization) to optimize database queries and Task #26 (Implement Real-time System Monitoring) to monitor system metrics.\n\n2. Create the frontend terminal-like interface component, integrating it with the backend service developed in step 1.\n\n3. Implement a security command whitelist and user permission checks, utilizing the authentication and authorization mechanisms established in Task #24 (Implement User Authentication & Authorization).\n\n4. Integrate real-time WebSocket for live command output streaming, leveraging the WebSocket connections established in Task #30 (Implement Real-time Metrics).\n\n5. Perform thorough testing to ensure secure command execution, proper user permission checks, and accurate command logging.",
        "testStrategy": "Test the following aspects:\n\n1. Command execution: Test that commands are executed correctly without security breaches.\n\n2. Security validation: Verify that the command whitelist and user permission checks function as intended.\n\n3. Real-time WebSocket: Ensure live command output streaming is accurate and secure.\n\n4. Logging and audit: Confirm proper logging and auditing of commands, including system metrics collected in Task #26.",
